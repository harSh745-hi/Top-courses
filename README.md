🚀 Just built my first React project – Top Courses App!

This simple web app helped me understand and apply:

🔁 React Hooks like useState and useEffect
🔔 Toast notifications using react-toastify
📦 API integration for dynamic course listings
🎨 Icon usage with react-icons (like FcIcons)
🧠 Error handling and conditional rendering

The app fetches a list of top courses from a public API and displays them with a clean UI. Users can filter by category and get instant feedback via toast alerts.

💡 This project really helped me grasp core concepts of React like data fetching, state management, and using external packages.# Top-courses
